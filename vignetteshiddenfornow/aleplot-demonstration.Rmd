This Vignette is designed to demonstate the functionality and limitations of the AlePlotPlus package

First, let's demonstrate the package on a simple, simulated dataset
```{r cars}
# set the number of observations
n = 1000

# These values are going to be the coeffcients for the simulated linear model
b0 = 0
b1  = 10
b2  = 1
b3  = 10
b12 = 0
b13 = 10
b23 = 0

#simulate values of x1, x2, and x3 from a normal dist
x1 = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
x2 = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
x3 = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# simulate a small amount of noise to add the model 
eps = rnorm(n, mean = 0,sd = .001)

#Define linear model we will model using ALEs
y <- b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + b12*x1*x2 + b13*x1*x3 + b23*x3*x3 + eps

# Store model information in a dataframe
df = data.frame(x1 = x1,x2 = x2,x3 = x3, y = y)

# Define the original dataset minus the output variable, which is used to train ALEs
X = df[,-4]

mdl = randomForest::randomForest(y ~.,data = df)
```

```{r 1D4,echo = TRUE,results = 'hide',include=TRUE,fig.show='hide'}
pred.fun <- function(X.model, newdata) {
        prd_out = predict(X.model, newdata)
        return(prd_out)}

var_imps = calc_ALE_varimps_mean(X = X,
                                 X.MODEL = mdl,
                                 pred.fun = pred.fun,
                                 K = 40)
MainEffectALES = mkALEplots(X        = X,
                            X.MODEL  = mdl,
                            pred.fun = pred.fun,
                            K        = 40)
```

```{r 2}
var_imps
MainEffectALES
```

For these plots, the Y axis tracks the estimated effect of the variable on the prediction when the predictor is at
the value specified at the X value. The results correctly estimate that x1 and x3 have roughly 10x the effect on the result as x2. The ALEPlots are generally correctly describe the linear relationship between each predictor
and the outcome. You can observe here that ALEs are generally less accurate at the extreme values as there is less data at those values. This software includes a rugplot in the estimates to assist in identifying areas where the model may be less accurate.

Now let's examine the interactions


```{r 3,echo = T,include=T,results = 'hide',fig.show='hide'}
ALEints = find_ALE_interacts(X,
                             X.MODEL  = mdl,
                             pred.fun = pred.fun,
                             K        = 40)
create_2D_ALEs(X,
               X.MODEL = mdl,
               pred.fun = pred.fun,
               K        = 40,
               savedir  = "~/exampleplots")
```


```{r 4}
clrs = QckRBrwrPllt(name = "OrRd",n = 100)
ints4heatmap = ALEPlotPlus::interacts2_heatmap(ALEints)
ints4heatmap
pheatmap::pheatmap(ints4heatmap,color = clrs)

knitr::include_graphics("~/exampleplots/x1x2.jpeg")
knitr::include_graphics("~/exampleplots/x1x3.jpeg")
```
For each interaction ALEPlot, the color indicates the estimated effect of the interaction between both
predictors on the prediction at the given value of both predictors. AlePlotPlus correctly identifies the interaction. Within the 2D ALE Plot, you cansee that points with high X1 and X3 values have higher values than either value 
would suggest in themselves. There is no such clear pattern for the other X1 X2 interaction. The total impact of the interaction is estimated as the average estimated effect of the interaction across all data.

To conclude, this package requires the same inputs as the ALE package 1) A fitted model, 2) The data needed to create
that model. 3) A function which uses that model to make a prediction. Using the ALE model, variable importance scores
can be estimated at the model can be visualized as described.
